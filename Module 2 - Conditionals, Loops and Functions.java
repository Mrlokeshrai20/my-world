Question 1: Write a Java program that takes a number as input and prints whether it's positive, negative, or zero.



Question 2: Create a Java program that checks if a year is a leap year. A leap year is divisible by 4 but not by 100, or it is divisible by 400.




Question 3: Write a Java program that prints the first N Fibonacci numbers using a loop (iteration) instead of recursion




Question 4: Create a Java program that calculates the factorial of a number using a while loop.




Question 5: Write a Java function that takes an array of integers as input and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the array.


Question 6: What is the output of the following code?
 int x = 5;
if (x > 0) {
    for (int i = 0; i < x; i++) {
        System.out.print(i + " ");

a) 0 1 2 3 4
b) 1 2 3 4 5
c) Negative number
d) Compilation error

a) const int MY_CONSTANT = 10;
b) constant MY_CONSTANT = 10;
c) final int MY_CONSTANT = 10;
d) static int MY_CONSTANT = 10;


Question 8: What is the purpose of the continue statement in a loop?

a) To exit the loop
b) To skip the rest of the code inside the loop and move to the next iteration
c) To restart the loop
d) To check a condition


Question 9: What is the output of the following code?
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.print(i + " ");
}

a) 0 1 2 3 4
b) 1 2 3 4 5
c) 0 1 2 3
