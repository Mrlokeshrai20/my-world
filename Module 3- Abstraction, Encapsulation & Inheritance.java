Question 1: In Java, what is abstraction, and how is it achieved using abstract classes and interfaces?
Provide an example of a Java interface and a class implementing it to illustrate abstraction.



Question 2: Explain encapsulation in the context of Java. Describe how access modifiers (public, private, protected) 
and getter and setter methods can be used for encapsulation in Java. Provide a code example to demonstrate encapsulation.




Question 3: How does inheritance work in Java, and what is the extends keyword used for?
Provide an example of a class hierarchy in Java, showcasing inheritance and method overriding.




Question 4: Create a Java program that demonstrates the concepts of abstraction and encapsulation in a real-world scenario. 
Define an abstract class and multiple concrete classes that extend it. Use encapsulation to protect the internal state of the classes,
and provide methods to interact with the objects.




Question 5: In Java, how does inheritance contribute to polymorphism? Provide a Java code example illustrating a class 
hierarchy with inheritance and demonstrate polymorphic behavior through method overriding.
