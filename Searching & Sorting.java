b) Sorts the elements of the array.
c) Searches for an element in the array.
d) Removes duplicates from the array.


9. In the context of searching algorithms, what is the significance of a negative result from Arrays.binarySearch?

a) The element is present at the index specified by the result.
b) The element is not present in the array.
c) The array is not sorted.
d) The search is inconclusive.
